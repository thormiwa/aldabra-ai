Hi!

At aldabra our goal is to optimize and simlify healthcare system in africa
by using the best tech and open source AI solutions out there...

our first solution is to release a SaaS platform that reduces repetitivet tasks
and Improves hospital efficiency, this would be achieved by

- providing an easy way for patients to search for doctors and healthcare facilities and
clinics that best suits thier needs

- as well as book appointments easily with thoes facilities

- our platform would also simplify the way doctors interact with their patients by
providing an easy appointment management system, a dashboard to see patients health
details like graphs, medical records etc...

- our platform would also enable hospitals, find patient medical records and history
in the most efficient way possible

- we'd also including a virtual ticketing system that would enable patients queue
online for a certain time before heading to the hospital for thier appointments, we
believe that this would reduce the spread of the covid 19 virus

- patients would also be able to manage thier appointments and get to manage their
medical data like, uploading their medical records if available or requesting it practicing
from their healthcare provider if registered with aldabra

- hospitals should be able to manage hospital activities like easy registeration
and onboarding of new patients, managing and viewing doctor appointments,
managing available rooms etc an all round management system from a simplified
dashboard

- and finally for our MVP we would also focus on reducing mental health issues
by providing an easy video conferencing call with doctors when in need,
integrating daily mental wellness routings, and a feed for mental health and healthy
content that would see accurate and healthy content from verified healthcare facilities and
practioners published.
